# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

This repository has all my practice and implementations of different data structures and algorithms in Python.
Although I have implemented all fundamental data structures and algorithms in Java, I wanted to test myself to do the same in Python.
I am adding more to it every day and hopefully you can benefit from the code.
